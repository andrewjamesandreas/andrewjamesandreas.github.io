Below are some notes I have created on various math and statistics topics which I wanted to refamiliarise myself. There are various other sets of notes under construction which will be added to the list as they are finished. 

Please feel free to use these notes if you find them helpful and please let me know if you find any errors (I am sure there will be) or on how I can improve them.

## Math 
- [Calculus - Differentiation in Several Variables](/files/Calculus%20-%20Differentiation%20in%20Several%20Variables.pdf)

## Statistics 

### Classical Inference 
- [Point Estimation](/files/Statistics%20-%20Point%20Estimation.pdf)
- [Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals](/files/Statistics%20-%20Hypothesis%20Tests%20and%20Confidence%20Intervals.pdf)

### Bayesian Statistics
