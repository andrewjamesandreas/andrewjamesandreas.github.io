I am currently looking for a new role as a quantitative researcher or data scientist in financial markets. My previous work experience includes working in Blackstone's Real Estate Private Equity team in London from October 2021 through to June 2024. 

I studied at Imperial College London for my bachelors in Chemistry and followed this with a masters in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have a deep interest in maths, statistics and machine learning, particularly as it relates to financial markets. I created this website so that I may document my progress, thoughts and ideas as I look to pivot into a more quantitative and data-driven role as an investor. 

## What I am working on 
At the moment I am focusing mainly on re-familiarizing myself with the core building blocks that underpin modern ML (i.e., the fundamental math and statistics) and doing some side projects to both aid my learning and develop my programming skills. 

I have created sets of notes that are linked on the website which I have found useful and hope others may also find them useful.   

### Resources I am using 
-  [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)
-  [Vector Calculus](https://universitytime.home.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1.vector-cal-4.pdf)
-  [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf)

### Future reading 
There are a multitude of books I want to read but just to name a few which I believe will really help on this journey
* [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)
* [Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts](https://www.bishopbook.com/)
* [Trader Construction Kit](https://www.traderconstructionkit.com/)
