My name is Andrew Andreas and I have a deep interest in maths, statistics and machine learning. I created this personal website so that I may share my thoughts and ideas. 

I am looking for a new role as a quantitative researcher or data scientist in financial markets. I think can add most value in a quantamental investment role where I can leverage my previous work experience at Blackstone. 

I graduated with distinction in my masters in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Imperial College London and prior to this I studied a bachelors in Chemistry, graduating with First-Class Honours.
